# Experiment 1

## Aim:

Installation of R and R Studio

## Theory:

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in popularity; as of February 2020, R ranks 13th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.

A GNU package, the official R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself (thus, it is partially self-hosting) and is freely available under the GNU General Public License. Pre-compiled executables are provided for various operating systems. Although R has a command line interface, there are several third-party graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment, and Jupyter, a notebook interface.

## Procedure:

The process of installing R on different operating systems is different, we shall be seeing it for Ubuntu and WIndows in our study. 



* ### Windows
  
  - Installing R-base
  
              1. Navigate to [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)
  
              2.Click on base, and select the link to download the base package.
  
              3.Double click and install by following the instructions on the Screen.
  
  - Installing R-studio

    2. Click on "Download RStudio Desktop."
    3. Click on the version recommended for your system, or the latest Windows version, and save the executable file.  Run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
       
       

* ### Linux
  
  * Installing R-base
  1. Open a terminal by ALT+CTRL+T (or anything Identical)
  
  2. Type in `sudo apt update`
  
  3. Then so as to install R, `sudo apt install r-base`
  - Installing R-studio 
    
    1. Go to terminal and type in `wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/trusty/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.5033-amd64.deb`
    
    2. Then `sudo dpkg -i rstudio-server-1.2.5033.amd64.deb`
    
    3. Wait for installation to finish.
